# Server-side rendering in Node.js
This project demonstrates how to render web pages on the server and send them as HTML to the frontend, improving loading speed and reducing the load on the frontend. We used the MVC architecture to keep the code clean, readable, and organized.

## Topics covered

* Server-side rendering of HTML in Node.js.
* Using EJS (Embedded JavaScript) with Node.js.
* Improving code structure and maintainability with MVC.
