# Introduction to MongoDB and Mongoose
In this project, I explore how to incorporate the MVC (Model View Controller) pattern in an Express server to create a modular code structure, making code easier to manage and maintain.

## Topics covered

* Segregating code into modules based on the MVC pattern.
* Understanding the workings and principles of MVC.
* Enhancing code readability and maintainability with MVC.

## For running the project
**Note:** Ensure MongoDB is properly installed and running locally on your machine. Start the MongoDB server before sending any requests to the database. You will need to provide the database URL in the 'makeconnection' method in index.js file.
```bash
1. Fork this repository.
2. Navigate to the folder: "http module for requests and responses".
3. Run npm install in your terminal to install dependencies.
4. Run the server with node <file-name> in the terminal.
```
