# Uploading files using Multer
"We're learning how to upload files using Multer, a handy Node.js middleware that makes the process efficient and hassle-free. Instead of overloading the database with large files, Multer helps keep things snappy by handling file storage separately. It also takes care of file types, structure, and security, making uploads smoother and more secure."

## Topics covered

- Handling large files separately from the database for better efficiency  
- Understanding the basics of Multer and how to use it in a project  
- Why tools like Multer are useful for file uploads
